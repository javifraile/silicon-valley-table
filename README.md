# Silicon Valley Episodes

A small fullstack project that obtains through an Express app a dataset of the HBO series Silicon Valley
and returns the list of episodes via a route. On the frontend, a React app fetch the list and
renders it inside a table. Its posible to do client-side filtering on the episodes by title or season.

By default the backend will serve with the PORT 3001 and 3000 for the frontend on develop and 5000 on prod.
